[![Gitpod Ready-to-Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-Ready--to--Code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://gitlab.stud.idi.ntnu.no/it1901/groups-2020/gr2060/gr2060)


## Project structure
The project is seperated into five modules:
* Application logic is under *studit/core/..*  
* GUI implementations is under *studit/fxui/..*
* The RESTApi is under *studit/fxui/restapi/..*
* Server (Grizzly) server code is under *studit/restserver/..*
* Servlet (Jersey) is under *studit/servlet/..*
---
Main code for each module is found under *src/main/..*  
Testing for each module is found under *src/test/..*  

## Installation and testing
The project uses maven for building and running.

* To build the project, click the gitpod link and run: `mvn install` in the root folder, to run all the testes and quality checking.

* To build the project without testes run: `mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true` in the root folder

* To run the server, you have to run: `mvn jetty:run -f servlet/pom.xml`

* To run the project: First you need to install the project `mvn install`, then run the server, and finally run `mvn javafx:run -f fxui/pom.xml`

* For unit testing and code coverage, run `mvn test`  

To login once the application is started, enter *user* as username and *password* as password, or create a new user.

If you are curious about how to use the chatbot, check the documentation found in studit/core/chatbot

Code coverage is found under *target/site/jacoco*

**NOTE**

TestFx is not stable during testing of the fxui module, and sometimes a `NoSuchElementException` will be thrown during the test phase of the build. Should this occur, simply rebuilding the module usually resolves the issue.
